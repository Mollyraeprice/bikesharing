Lastly, these three graphs should that most weekday rides are during rush hour times. During the weekend, it is after dawn and before sundown that bikes are most often riden. It is still more popular for men to use the bikes. 

# Summary

Looking back at our data, we can see that more men are riding bikes than women during all hours, but espescially rush hour. This most likely means that people are using it for commuting to work.
